# Random Movement of 3 Balls

## Description
This is a project I created in Week 3 of MITxPro Professional Certificate in Coding (Full Stack Dev). I used knowledge of JavaScript to create and animate 3 balls which bounced off the boundaries of a specified box. 

Initial code and instructions for this project were provided by MITxPro program staff. This project was part of a required assignment.
